# RPN Calculator and CSV Formula Evaluator

## Description
This project combines the functionality of a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator with a CSV file formula evaluator. It allows users to perform complex arithmetic operations in RPN format and to process CSV files where cells can contain both direct numerical values and formulas expressed in RPN.

## Features
- **RPN Calculator**: Perform arithmetic operations using the Reverse Polish Notation.
- **CSV Formula Evaluator**: Reads CSV files, evaluates formulas in RPN contained within cells, and outputs the results.
- **Cell Reference Support**: Formulas in CSV files can reference the value of other cells, allowing for dynamic computation based on the spreadsheet's data.
- **Extensible Functionality**: Easily extendable to include more mathematical operations and functions.
